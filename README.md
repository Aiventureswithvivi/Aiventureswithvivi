- âš¡ Fun fact: From coast to coast, I embarked on a 12-state karaoke crawl, uncovering the top venues and even joining in on some local competitions. Singing has always been in my DNAâ€”I was a choir kid through and through, performing and competing for as long as I can remember. Karaoke is how I keep that passion alive!
